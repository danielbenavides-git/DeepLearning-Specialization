## Specialization Overview

The *Deep Learning Specialization* provides a practical and structured introduction to modern deep learning. It covers the core ideas behind neural networks and shows how they are applied to real-world problems in computer vision, natural language processing, and sequence modeling.

The emphasis is on building intuition, understanding why models work, and implementing them from scratch before moving to higher-level frameworks.

## Course Content

### Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning  
Introduces the foundations of neural networks, including forward and backward propagation, activation functions, and basic optimization. Focuses on building intuition for how deep learning models learn from data.

### Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks  
Covers techniques to improve performance and stability, such as initialization strategies, regularization, optimization algorithms, and practical hyperparameter tuning.

### Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects  
Focuses on how to make effective modeling decisions, prioritize ideas, and structure machine learning projects using real-world case studies.

### Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks  
Explores deep learning for computer vision, including convolutional architectures, transfer learning, and applications such as object detection and image segmentation.

### Course 5: Sequence Models  
Introduces models for sequential data, including RNNs, LSTMs, attention mechanisms, and transformers, with applications in natural language processing and time-series tasks.
